## The Basics - Understanding Git:
Common locations where code stays in git:
1. Local Working Directory (Code Playground)
2. Staging Area (Temporary holding spot for files before commiting)
3. Local Repository (Place where we store commited changes locally)
4. Remote Repository (Server for sharing and backing up code)
